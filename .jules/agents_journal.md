## 2024-05-20 - 🎧 Vibe - Feature Materialized: PR Queue Panel
**Learning:** Found an implied missing feature in the execution interface: the ability to monitor the open pull requests of a targeted repository.
**Action:** Implemented `getPullRequests` in `JulesService` and a corresponding rendering panel `julesPRPanel` under the Jules Runner Panel, pulling data directly via the GitHub API to increase system observability without leaving the interface.

## 2025-05-20 - 🕴️ Hitman - [Client non-response/rejected targets]
**Learning:** Target Dossier executed. Client authorized elimination of targets 8, 9, and 10. Targets 1-7, 11, and 12 were implicitly rejected.
**Action:** Targets 8, 9, 10 (Scope Creep Category C - Extra Utility Scripts) were destroyed along with the contract file. I will not propose the rejected targets in future sweeps unless conditions drastically change.

## 2024-05-20 - ⬜ Minimalist - [Visual Bloat Purged: AgentCard Wrappers]
**Learning:** Found an unused CSS class `.picker-search` and an empty nested wrapper `.title-wrapper` inside the AgentCard component that contributed only to visual bloat and a bloated DOM. A flexbox wrapper with a single element child doesn't accomplish anything special relative to layout.
**Action:** Flattened empty DOM structure in `AgentCard.js` by dropping `.title-wrapper` and removing dead CSS classes to shrink file sizes. Use native `npx purgecss` to verify orphaned CSS references prior to removing them.
