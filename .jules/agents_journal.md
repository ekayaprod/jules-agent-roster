## 2024-05-20 - 🎧 Vibe - Feature Materialized: PR Queue Panel
**Learning:** Found an implied missing feature in the execution interface: the ability to monitor the open pull requests of a targeted repository.
**Action:** Implemented `getPullRequests` in `JulesService` and a corresponding rendering panel `julesPRPanel` under the Jules Runner Panel, pulling data directly via the GitHub API to increase system observability without leaving the interface.

## 2025-05-20 - 🕴️ Hitman - [Client non-response/rejected targets]
**Learning:** Target Dossier executed. Client authorized elimination of targets 8, 9, and 10. Targets 1-7, 11, and 12 were implicitly rejected.
**Action:** Targets 8, 9, 10 (Scope Creep Category C - Extra Utility Scripts) were destroyed along with the contract file. I will not propose the rejected targets in future sweeps unless conditions drastically change.

## 2024-05-20 - ⬜ Minimalist - [Visual Bloat Purged: AgentCard Wrappers]
**Learning:** Found an unused CSS class `.picker-search` and an empty nested wrapper `.title-wrapper` inside the AgentCard component that contributed only to visual bloat and a bloated DOM. A flexbox wrapper with a single element child doesn't accomplish anything special relative to layout.
**Action:** Flattened empty DOM structure in `AgentCard.js` by dropping `.title-wrapper` and removing dead CSS classes to shrink file sizes. Use native `npx purgecss` to verify orphaned CSS references prior to removing them.

## 2026-03-09 - 👷 Foreman - [Enforced Utility File Naming Convention]
**Learning:** Found a mixed casing convention inside the `js/Utils/` folder where files were improperly using `PascalCase` despite being utility files.
**Action:** Renamed all `.js` and `.test.js` utility files in `js/Utils/` to strictly follow `kebab-case` naming convention using `git mv` (e.g. `DOMUtils.js` -> `dom-utils.js`). Safely updated all global references without modifying internal exported class names. Handled dynamic module imports in `benchmark.js` where file basenames are matched and properly converted to PascalCase class exports, adding special casing for `DOMUtils`.

**Title**: 🦉 Scholar: [AgentCard Module Synthesis]
**Learning**: Discovered an orphaned inline JSDoc reference (`@see README.md#agentcard-architecture`) in `AgentCard.js` where the target `README.md` file did not exist in the module directory.
**Action**: Synthesized a comprehensive macro architecture `README.md` mapping the DOM structure, event delegation, contextual actions, and render throttling, and strictly typed/cross-linked the inline JSDoc comments to establish a verified single source of truth.
