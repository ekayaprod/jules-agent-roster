# 🖼️ Curator Log (2025-05-24)

## 🔍 Inventory Findings
- **Heavy Files (>1MB)**: None found.
- **Image Assets**: No unreferenced PNG/JPG/WebP files found in repository root or `prompts/`.
- **Ghost Assets**: `verification/roster_verified.webp` (generated by `verify_roster.py`) was identified and cleaned up.
- **SVG Optimization**: Inline SVGs in `index.html` were inspected and deemed minimal (no metadata, optimized paths).

## 🏁 Conclusion
Phase 2 (Curator) completed. No assets required optimization or deletion beyond routine cleanup.
