## 2026-03-01 - Hybrid Tailwind & Standard CSS
**Learning:** `index.html` relies on a hybrid of utility classes and direct global CSS selectors (e.g., standard `button`, `input` tags styled directly in the `<style>` block). Standard Tailwind interaction utility classes (like `hover:bg-blue-600`) are not explicitly mapped; instead, pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, `:active`, `:disabled`) must be appended directly into the global style block or component-specific blocks.
**Action:** When mutating interactive states in `index.html`, avoid injecting standard Tailwind pseudo-classes into class attributes, and instead write targeted standard CSS pseudo-class selectors directly into the embedded `<style>` block. Ensure mouse-accessibility by prioritizing `:focus-visible` over `:focus`.
