**Learning:** Simulated keyboard events (e.g., `Enter` on a button) in headless Playwright environments may not reliably trigger native `click` or `keydown` events due to focus timing or browser quirks. Explicit `keydown` handlers for activation keys (Enter/Space) provide robustness, but testing them may require workarounds (like using `.click()` to open) while still verifying the listener logic via other keys (Escape/Arrows).
**Action:** Always include explicit `keydown` handlers for interactive elements to ensure accessibility compliance, even if native `<button>` behavior covers it in most browsers. Use verification scripts that isolate specific behaviors (e.g., testing `Escape` key logic separately from activation logic).
