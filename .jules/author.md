## 2024-05-22 - [Missing Architecture Documentation]
**Learning:** The `js/` directory contained complex fusion logic (`FusionCompiler.js`, `FusionLab.js`) but lacked any architectural overview, forcing developers to read raw code to understand data flow.
**Action:** Created `js/README.md` detailing the component hierarchy and data flow. Added `prompts/README.md` to standardize agent creation.
