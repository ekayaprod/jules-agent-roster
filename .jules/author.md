## 2024-05-22 - [Missing Architecture Documentation]
**Learning:** The `js/` directory contained complex fusion logic (`FusionCompiler.js`, `FusionLab.js`) but lacked any architectural overview, forcing developers to read raw code to understand data flow.
**Action:** Created `js/README.md` detailing the component hierarchy and data flow. Added `prompts/README.md` to standardize agent creation.

## 2024-05-24 - [Missing Strict Formatting in Major READMEs]
**Learning:** Found missing documentation standards in major domains like `prompts/README.md` that were missing "Purpose", "Quick Start", and "Architecture" sections, which could block developers trying to add or understand prompt agents.
**Action:** Overwrote `prompts/README.md` to strictly follow the required macro-documentation format, adding Purpose, Quick Start, and Architecture sections in a clear, imperative voice.
