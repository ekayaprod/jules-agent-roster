## 2026-03-01 - [Version 0.4.0 Release]
**Learning:** Significant feature and systemic refactoring updates (e.g., TCG Rarity System, modular UI, light mode) often don't contain a specific Git tag, meaning manual commit parsing since the last tracked commit is required to accurately categorize changes and bump versions.
**Action:** When no clear version tag exists or tags fail to describe correctly, use `git log --oneline <last_known_commit>..HEAD` to accurately identify untagged feature additions and appropriately enforce a Minor version bump.

## Notes
- Initialized changelog and version tracking.
- Detected addition of 4 new agents via Modernizer.
- Validated massive content expansion (50+ agents) alongside Bolt+ performance optimization. Bumped to Minor version 0.3.0.
