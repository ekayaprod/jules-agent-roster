# Wordsmith Journal

This journal tracks inconsistent terminology and Voice & Tone patterns across the application.

## 📝 Inconsistent Terminology
- **Success Messages:** Found multiple variants ("Copied!", "Copied to clipboard!", "${name} prompt copied!", "Full Roster copied!"). Standardized to **"Copied to clipboard"** for toasts and **"Copied!"** for button states.
- **Copy Actions:** Found "Copy Roster" (previously "Copy Full Roster"). Renamed to **"Copy All Prompts"** to be more specific and active.
- **Download Actions:** Found "Export Markdown". Renamed to **"Download All Prompts"** for consistency with copy actions.

## 🗣️ Voice & Tone Patterns
- **Empty States:** Moving from passive "No agents match..." to helpful/active "No agents found. Try adjusting...".
- **Error Messages:** Replacing technical jargon ("local server", "HTTP error") with user-centric conversational errors ("Check your connection").
- **Agent Descriptions:** Standardized bundle agent descriptions (Steward, Mechanic, Librarian) to use active voice and full sentences (e.g., "Performs weekly maintenance..." instead of "Weekly maintenance...").
