This document outlines the strategic direction for the **Jules Agent Roster**.

## 📍 Phase 1: Stabilization & Foundation (Current)
*Focus: Accessibility, Portability, and Core Agent Quality*

- [x] **Single-File Portability**: Ensure the entire roster remains a single `index.html` for easy deployment/usage.
- [x] **Accessibility First**: Maintain high A11y standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, reduced motion support).
- [ ] **Agent Verification**: Manually verify that all agent prompts adhere to the "Plus" philosophy.
- [x] **Documentation**: Ensure `README.md` accurately reflects the latest agent capabilities.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Expansion & Specialization (Q3)
*Focus: Broadening the Roster*

- [ ] **New Agent Categories**: Explore specialized agents for Data Science, DevOps, and Mobile dev.
- [ ] **Framework-Specific Variants**: Create variants of agents for specific stacks (e.g., Next.js vs. Remix vs. Vue).
- [ ] **Community Contributions**: Streamline the process for community submitted agents.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Tooling & Automation (Future)
*Focus: Quality Assurance*

- [ ] **Prompt Validation**: Implement scripts to parse and validate the JSON/Markdown structure within agent prompts.
- [x] **Automated Testing**: Add basic tests for the `index.html` UI logic (search, filtering, copying).
- [ ] **CLI Tool**: Potential CLI to fetch specific agents directly into the terminal.

## 📦 Backlog (Unscheduled)
- [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle (currently Dark only).
- [ ] LocalStorage persistence for "Favorites" or "Recently Used".
